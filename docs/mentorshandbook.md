# Scroll of the Guildmasters: Mentor Pact & Circlemaster Handbook

## I. The Pact of Mentorship

All Guildmasters shall abide by the sacred pact inscribed below, binding their role not only to knowledge, but to the noble craft of guiding fellow seekers.

### 🕊️ Oath of the Guildmaster

* I pledge to nurture curiosity, not answers.
* I shall listen more than I speak.
* I will honor the time of my Apprentices, and never belittle their questions.
* I shall remain humble in mastery, knowing I am always a student of the arcane.

### 🔥 Expectations of Mentorship

* **Minimum Presence**: Attend at least 2 convocations per moon (biweekly live sessions).
* **Guildstone Communication**: Be active in designated channels (Discord/Matrix/etc).
* **Quest Review**: Evaluate at least one Apprentice submission or quest per cycle.
* **Office Hour Rituals**: Offer one open hour per moon for Q\&A with Apprentices.

### ⚖️ Ethos in Conflict

* De-escalate, never dominate.
* If grievances arise, raise them in Circle or before the High Council.
* Preserve the dignity of all Apprentices — none shall be mocked, ignored, or left behind.

## II. The Circlemaster Handbook

When a Guildmaster is chosen to lead a Circle of Craft, they don the mantle of **Circlemaster**, and assume both stewardship and scholarly duty.

### 🧭 Duties of a Circlemaster

* **Hold the Flame**: Lead a weekly session on a chosen arcane theme or artifact (topic).
* **Forge the Quests**: Propose self-learning paths and hands-on tasks for Apprentices.
* **Track the Scrolls**: Maintain a log of attendance, engagement, and progress.
* **Cross-Circle Alliances**: Encourage collaboration with other Circlemasters when quests intersect domains.

### 📚 Knowledge Curation

* Maintain a shared Codex of learning resources (GitBook, Notion, GitHub).
* Annotate important links and references for ease of access by Apprentices.

### 🎓 End-of-Cycle Duties

* Nominate Apprentices for graduation or Rite of Ascension.
* Present final showcases to the High Council.
* Propose changes to the Circle’s structure, curriculum, or leadership if needed.
