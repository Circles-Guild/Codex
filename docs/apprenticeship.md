# Evaluation & Progression Scrolls

These scrolls define how Apprentices shall be evaluated, elevated, and—should they stray from the path—guided back or released. It provides the framework by which growth, effort, and mastery are measured.

## 1. Path of the Apprentice

All Apprentices begin their journey as Seekers. Through quests, trials, and convocation, they progress along the following path:

* **Seeker** (Initiate) – Weeks 1–2
* **Craftsworn** (Active Learner) – Weeks 3–4
* **Forgeborn** (Independent Builder) – Weeks 5–6
* **Ascendant** (Graduating Apprentice) – Weeks 7–8

Progression through each rank is marked by effort, project contribution, knowledge-sharing, and fulfillment of Circle duties.

## 2. Evaluation Rites

Each Apprentice shall be observed by their Circlemasters and Guildmasters during these periods:

### Weekly Reflections

* Apprentices submit a short journal of their learnings, blockers, and breakthroughs.
* Circlemasters review and provide gentle nudges or guidance.

### Quest Reviews

* Upon completing each quest (task/project), Guildmasters assess:

  * Understanding of the underlying craft
  * Creativity in implementation
  * Documentation & reproducibility

### Mid-Journey Convocation (Week 4)

* All Apprentices gather with Circlemasters.
* Honest review of progress.
* The unengaged are gently excused from the Guild.

### Final Trial (Week 8)

* A final quest or artifact must be submitted.
* Peer review encouraged.
* Completion grants the title of Ascendant and marks the end of apprenticeship.

## 3. Graduation & Beyond

### Rite of Passage

Those who complete the journey are eligible to:

* Join the ranks of Guildmasters (upon invitation or vote)
* Be Circlemasters for the next cycle
* Represent the Guild in external events or open-source quests

### Recognition

* A scroll of honor shall be posted in the Hall of Archives (Website/Notion/GitHub)
* Optionally, mentors may provide recommendation parchments (letters)

## 4. Guardianship Principles

### Fairness

* Each Circle ensures apprentices are judged not by talent alone, but by consistency, curiosity, and care.

### Inclusion

* Apprentices from all realms (backgrounds) shall be given equal chance and guidance.

### Feedback

* All evaluation rites include two-way scrolls: mentors also receive reflections from apprentices.

> May these Scrolls preserve fairness, recognize effort, and light the path for every Seeker of the Guild.
