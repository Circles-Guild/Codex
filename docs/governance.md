## 1. Invocation

This scroll defines the sacred governance of **The Crcls Guild**. It chronicles the order’s structure, the roles of its members, and the rites by which harmony and wisdom shall be preserved within our Guild.

## 2. Core Tenets of the Guild

- Unyielding pursuit of knowledge
- Mentorship born of gratitude and purpose
- Technology as a noble craft to aid humankind
- Shielded from commerce, rooted in curiosity
- Open to all seekers regardless of origin

## 3. Hierarchy of the Guild

### Guildmasters (Mentors)

- Once Apprentices, now seasoned in their craft.
- Guide Guild Circles or hold seats in the High Council.

### Apprentices (Mentees)

- Chosen through sacred trials (applications).
- Commit to a journey of 3–6 moons of learning and building.

### Sages (Advisors)

- Honored elders whose wisdom shapes the Guild’s destiny.

## 4. Circles of Craft (Guild Circles)

Circles form around domains of the arcane arts — the crafts of modern technology.

### Examples:

- Circle of Spirits (AI)
- Circle of Shields (Security)
- Circle of Systems (Infra & OS)
- Circle of Forms (Frontend)
- Circle of Flow (DevOps)

### Composition:

- **Circlemaster**: A Guildmaster elected to lead.
- **Members**: Apprentices and Guildmasters united by interest.

### Duties:

- Hold convocations and track progress.
- Judge quests (projects) taken by Apprentices.
- Forge tools, both open and secret.

## 5. The High Council (Council of Elders)

The ruling council that guards the Guild’s vision.

### Duties:

- Bless the scrolls of learning (curriculum).
- Sanction or dissolve Circles.
- Initiate new Guildmasters.
- Settle disputes with wisdom.

### Composition:

- 3 to 7 Guildmasters, including the Grand Archon (Chair).
- Re-elected every cycle (one batch).

## 6. Rite of Ascension (Elections & Tenure)

### Frequency:

- Held once per celestial cycle (year).

### Who May Ascend:

- Only Guildmasters may be nominated or cast a vote.
- Apprentices turned Guildmasters are eligible.

### The Rite:

1. Nominations open to the Guild.
2. Each nominee declares their vision.
3. The Guild casts sacred ballots.
4. Highest votes ascend. Ties are broken by the Sages.

### Term:

- The High Council and Circlemasters serve a full cycle (6–12 moons).

## 7. The Code of Honor

All who enter the Guild must:

- Show respect to all, regardless of realm or creed.
- Forbear from peddling or profiteering.
- Safeguard secrets and whispers shared.
- Embody curiosity, effort, and grace.

Transgressions lead to exile — warnings, banishment from Circles, or removal from the Guild.

## 8. Rewriting the Codex

Any Guildmaster may petition for change.

- The scroll is placed before the High Council.
- Debate ensues; a vote is cast.
- If the majority agrees, the change is inscribed with the next cycle.
